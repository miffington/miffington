- 👋 Hi, I’m @miffington
- 👀 I’m interested in computer games, new innovating programming projects and basic nerd stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Atom, Windows 11's secrets and spending some time in docs.microsoft.com
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on work related projects and hoping to get close and work with my friends who are related into programming.
      Hoping some day I might get back in some fresh project.
